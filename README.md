# AnyWear E2E

System-level tests for a reviewed combination of `AnyWear-Client` and
`AnyWear-Service`. This repository owns only behavior that crosses deployable
boundaries; repository-local tests remain with the Client or Service.

## Test Boundary

- Browser behavior with mocked APIs belongs in `AnyWear-Client`.
- Route, database, contract, and infrastructure tests belong in `AnyWear-Service`.
- Browser flows that use both the real Client and Service belong here.
- Real cloud smoke tests belong here and must be explicitly tagged.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24
- pnpm 11.18.0
- AWS credentials for the Beta test identity boundary
- Deployed Beta Client and Service endpoints with HTTPS

The preferred local layout is the AnyWear shell repository:

```text
AnyWear/
|-- AnyWear-Client/
|-- AnyWear-Service/
|-- AnyWear-Meta/
`-- AnyWear-E2E/
```

## Setup

Install dependencies from this repository:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Configure the ignored `.env` from `.env.example` with `E2E_STAGE=beta`,
`E2E_EXTERNAL_SERVERS=true`, the deployed `E2E_CLIENT_URL` and `E2E_SERVICE_URL`,
and Beta's Cognito IDs. The deployment workflows load the identity IDs from
`/anywear/beta/cognito_user_pool_id` and `/anywear/beta/cognito_client_id` in SSM.
Do not commit `.env` or Playwright authentication state.

The deployed qualification profile sets two workers, two active-account slots, four new
accounts per run, and two quarantine slots. Wardrobe tests use one exclusive synthetic
Cognito account per Playwright parallel slot, provisioned through the protected AWS admin
path and deleted during worker teardown. Public registration remains governed by the
Service-owned tester policy; ordinary qualification does not mutate admission policy or
require a real tester mailbox.
The qualification and integration workflows share a non-cancelling Beta account-pool
concurrency group, and each run uploads its account-budget manifest for recovery.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm check             # source checks, script tests, and Playwright test discovery; no browser execution
pnpm audit             # fail on high/critical dependency advisories
pnpm test:smoke        # on-demand deployed Beta diagnostic
pnpm test:full-stack   # deployed Beta scenarios marked @full-stack
pnpm test              # complete deployed Beta qualification suite
pnpm report            # open the latest HTML report
```

Playwright verifies the configured deployed stage endpoints. Browser execution fails
closed unless the stage is Beta or Production, external servers are selected, and both URLs use
HTTPS. Test discovery and source checks do not connect to the deployed environment.

## Execution Policy

Pull requests do not run cross-repository browser E2E as a required check. The E2E
Quality workflow runs compatibility validation, script tests, lint, type checking, and
Playwright test discovery. Client and Service workflows remain responsible for their
required unit, repository integration, contract, database, and browser integration tests.

The E2E Integration workflow is an on-demand deployed Beta smoke diagnostic and runs
only the small `@smoke` subset. It checks out the reviewed peer commits for diagnostic
revision evidence, verifies their deployed identities, and exercises Beta's real
identity boundary. It does not run a local database or mutate the deployment.
Only Beta Qualification can issue a passing qualification record.

The complete `pnpm test` suite is reserved for the deployed Beta Qualification workflow.
Only a passing run against the exact reviewed Client, Service, and E2E revisions produces
qualification evidence that Production may consume.

Test classification is explicit: `@smoke` marks the small, stable critical path for the
on-demand Beta diagnostic; `@full-stack` marks cross-repository scenarios. Beta
Qualification runs every discovered test, regardless of tag. Dev verification remains
in the Client and Service unit and integration suites.

The manual `Beta Qualification` workflow is the production-readiness gate for an
already-deployed Beta environment. It reads the reviewed full SHAs from
`compatibility.json`, verifies those identities against the deployed Client
`build-metadata.json` and Service `/health`, runs the complete suite, rechecks both
identities and the Service image digest, and uploads a checksummed qualification record.
A failed, mismatched, or changed deployment cannot issue a passing record. The workflow
requests 90-day artifact retention, subject to GitHub's configured
repository or organization ceiling; durable release-ledger storage remains
out of scope for the initial Production launch. The finite GitHub retention window is an
accepted trade-off: after the artifact expires, that qualification can no longer authorize a
new Production deployment or rollback and the candidate must be qualified again. Persistent
S3 evidence storage will be reconsidered only if long-term audit or rollback requirements arise.

## Runtime Reliability Evidence

### Tester Admission Verification (Historical)

The one-time deployed synthetic allowlist acceptance and recovery workflows were
retired after the feature's acceptance completed. Their historical evidence, including
the owner's real email-code and normal-login confirmation, is recorded in
[AnyWear issue #59](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/59). The ordinary
Beta Qualification workflow does not mutate tester policy or claim to verify a real
tester mailbox. Future changes to admission behavior should define only the focused
tests needed for that change; the retired deployed harness is not a standing release gate.

The wardrobe scenario verifies repeated `Idempotency-Key` confirmation before and after
completion, recovery after a browser reload, consistent terminal state in two browser
pages, and a monotonic state version. It requires a successful `ready` state, so a
provider failure cannot pass merely because the processing indicator disappears.

Expanded Beta and Production reliability drills are deferred to
[AnyWear issue #58](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/58); they are not current
personal closed-Beta acceptance gates and have not been passed. The manual runtime-drill
and dedicated runtime-recovery workflows were retired under
[issue #79](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/79). Historical Actions runs and
artifacts remain available as evidence of their actual outcomes.

The repository retains read-only planning, preflight, and evidence-verification helpers.
They are separate from `pnpm test` and do not start or restore runtime drills:

```bash
pnpm runtime:plan                 # writes runtime-drill-plan.json; no AWS calls
pnpm runtime:preflight            # reads Beta health, stacks, ECS services, and queue attributes
pnpm runtime:verify -- evidence.json
```

Set `E2E_STAGE=beta`, `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=650880818323`, `AWS_REGION=ap-east-1`, and both
HTTPS endpoint variables before the AWS-backed preflight. It checks deployed Client and
Service identities against `compatibility.json` and performs read-only observations.
Any future expanded-release work must first select the smallest required risk-based scope
in issue #58; the historical fault-injection design is not an instruction to rerun its
full matrix or rebuild a separate control platform.

The deployed Client must serve the exact reviewed build at an HTTPS URL, support its
browser routes, and expose `/build-metadata.json`. The Client-owned Beta workflow publishes
the static build to the Beta PlatformStack's CloudFront distribution; set `BETA_CLIENT_URL`
to that stable `https://<distribution>.cloudfront.net` endpoint before qualification.

## CI Model

`compatibility.json` is the CI source of truth for the Client and Service
revisions under test. It accepts only full commit SHAs; branch and tag names are
rejected. When invoked, the E2E Integration workflow checks out those exact private
repositories, including their recursive API submodules, and records every tested
revision as an artifact.

The AnyWear shell repository remains a convenient local workspace and may pin
the same revisions, but it does not run CI or hold cross-repository credentials.
Update `compatibility.json` only after the peer commits exist on their remotes
and their repository-owned pipelines pass.
