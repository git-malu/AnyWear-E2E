# AnyWear E2E

System-level tests for a reviewed combination of `AnyWear-Client` and
`AnyWear-Service`. This repository owns only behavior that crosses deployable
boundaries; repository-local tests remain with the Client or Service.

## Test Boundary

- Browser behavior with mocked APIs belongs in `AnyWear-Client`.
- Route and database tests belong in `AnyWear-Service`; CDK and infrastructure contract tests belong in `AnyWear-Infra` after the controlled ownership cutover.
- Browser flows that use both the real Client and Service belong here.
- Real cloud smoke tests belong here and must be explicitly tagged.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24
- pnpm 11.18.0
- AWS credentials for the Beta test identity boundary
- Deployed Beta Client and Service endpoints with HTTPS

## Setup

Install dependencies from this repository:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Configure the ignored `.env` from `.env.example` with `E2E_STAGE=beta`,
`E2E_EXTERNAL_SERVERS=true`, the deployed `E2E_CLIENT_URL` and `E2E_SERVICE_URL`,
and Beta's Cognito IDs. The deployment workflows load the identity IDs from
`/anywear/beta/cognito_user_pool_id` and `/anywear/beta/cognito_client_id` in SSM.
Do not commit `.env` or Playwright authentication state.

The deployed qualification profile sets two workers, two active-account slots, six new
account leases per run, and two quarantine slots. Beta registration is gated by the exact
tester allowlist, so an attempt may only use a listed address: each Playwright parallel slot
leases one of the eight stable worker-pool addresses
(`e2e-beta-worker-0-chromium@anywear.local` … `e2e-beta-worker-7-chromium@anywear.local`) and
`E2E_WORKER_SLOT_OFFSET` selects the first slot when a slot allocation must avoid one in use.
The identity is provisioned through the protected AWS admin path, deleted during worker
teardown, and its lease is released only after the subject is read back deleted. Ordinary
qualification never mutates the allowlist and needs no real tester mailbox. The retired
synthetic address family and `custom:e2e_bootstrap` marker are no longer written; a historical
captured identity in either worker family stays deletable.
The operations of the `qualify` entry share a non-cancelling Beta account-pool
concurrency group, and each run uploads its account-budget manifest for recovery.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm check             # vendored contract, explicit core contracts, lint, typecheck and safe discovery
pnpm test:core         # 21 registered offline identity/cleanup/qualification/artifact contracts
pnpm test:tool-regressions # the one retained offline operational-support test file
pnpm test:deferred-sqs  # two source-only SQS prototype test files; manual #58 review
pnpm audit             # fail on high/critical dependency advisories
pnpm test:smoke        # on-demand deployed Beta diagnostic, @smoke only
pnpm test:regression   # the release-gating deployed selection, @regression only
pnpm test:full-stack   # deployed Beta scenarios marked @full-stack
pnpm test              # the release-gating selection: identical to test:regression
pnpm report            # open the latest HTML report
```

Playwright verifies the configured deployed stage endpoints. Browser execution fails
closed unless the stage is Beta or Production, external servers are selected, and both URLs use
HTTPS. Test discovery and source checks do not connect to the deployed environment.

The explicit file lists in [package.json](package.json) are the suite registry. A new
test file needs an ownership/classification decision before it enters an executed
suite; a filename wildcard cannot select a routine or release gate. The
[scenario inventory](docs/scenario-inventory.md) is that classification for the
deployed scenarios: each one's policy class, intent, selecting invocation, evidence
level, cleanup contract and red-result meaning, plus the admission rule a new
scenario must satisfy.

| Command | Owner and trigger | Actual effects and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check` / `test:core` | E2E maintainers; the automatic Check entry (PR/main) and qualify preflight source preparation | Offline fixtures, temporary files/Git repositories, lint, typecheck and discovery; no credentials, cloud calls or deployed result |
| `test:tool-regressions` | E2E operational-tool maintainers; the automatic Check entry's `tool-regressions` job on every PR/main | The retained SSE replica-attribution contract: mocked AWS/fetch and temporary files; no AWS/App credentials or live diagnostic proof |
| `test:deferred-sqs` | Repository maintainer under [#58](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/58); manual future-protocol review only | Two offline ARM/ACK/FIRE prototype files; no live transport, trusted AWS identity or receipt proof, and no #54 acceptance claim |
| `test:smoke` | E2E maintainers; the `smoke` operation of the protected `qualify` entry | Real login/dashboard/wardrobe navigation using a bounded worker identity and existing cleanup contract; diagnostic only |
| `test:regression` / `test` | E2E maintainers; the `full` operation's protected Beta qualification suite step, or explicit local investigation | The release-gating business scenarios, including identity creation and cleanup and external VLM/provider work; only this operation and its evidence can qualify a release |
| `test:full-stack` | E2E maintainers; explicit local investigation | Every cross-repository scenario; not a release-gating selection on its own |

The release-gating selection, the smoke diagnostic and account recovery are
separated by the signed `operation` field, not by a workflow boundary, a step or a job. One
protected dispatch surface, the `qualify` entry in `beta-qualification.yml`, carries
`full`, `smoke` and `recover`. A release consumer accepts a qualification record
only from the `full` operation of a completed-success qualification run; the record states
`operation: full` and is produced only by that operation, so a `smoke` or
`recover` run can neither produce nor withhold a record the gate legitimately produced. The
three properties separation keeps are: the record is produced only by `full`; the record
binds the operation dispatched, so its producer is uniquely identifiable; and both this
repository's producer/verifier and the Infra-side executor allow-list check
`operation == full`. The [scenario inventory](docs/scenario-inventory.md) states which
verdict each invocation carries.

The 21 registered core files retain account-budget, Cognito cleanup, qualification
record, cleanup operation, wardrobe cleanup, worker cleanup and deployed-scenario
declaration contracts plus the v4 live-tuple contracts: `qualification-record.test.mjs`
(the live identity, the supported-Client floor and the v4 record), `infra-qualification.test.mjs`
(this repository's own platform observation, the record's self-containment and its release
consumer), `service-release.test.mjs` (the immutable Service release identity, the
four-asset gate, the five-asset transition and the no-asset-read rule), and
`entry-census.test.mjs`, which asserts the two-entry face, the one manual dispatch surface,
the credential ordering, the absence of an approval job and the single
`ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION` name. `test:core` also owns
`scripts/beta-cleanup-diagnostic.test.mjs`, which asserts the cleanup diagnostic's
`DIAGNOSTIC_EXPECTED` evidence record offline and its manifest-free Service release
resolution, without credentials, cloud calls or deployed reads; it belongs with its
`service-cleanup-operation.test.mjs` and `worker-cleanup.test.mjs` neighbours, and its
production module is consumed by `scripts/account-recovery-inputs.mjs` and
`scripts/cleanup-worker-accounts.mjs`. The live-tuple contracts protect the observed
deployed identity, the supported-Client floor and the immutable release binding; their
offline assertions remain required by `check` without claiming actual publication or
qualification.

The automatic `Check` entry's `tool-regressions` job runs the one retained operational-support
test file, its implementation and shared evidence/source contracts, the
vendored deployment contract (the v3 core plus the v4 Service bake gate) with its
provenance assertion, and
the lockfile. `quality.yml` carried no path
filter, so that job now runs on every check rather than only on its former path set; the
cost is recorded in the PR body for #163. Both jobs have only `contents: read` and no
deployment environment or credential steps. SQS prototypes are excluded from both routine
core and tool checks and retain their [source-only handoff](scripts/beta-sqs-boundary-handoff.md).
The accepted [testing principles](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-Meta/blob/main/architecture/system-component-architecture/technical-architecture/devops/test/test_governance.md)
define the classification, cost, evidence, admission and retirement policy this
repository applies.

## Execution Policy

Pull requests do not run cross-repository browser E2E as a required check. The E2E
Check entry runs the vendored-contract assertion, the explicit 21 core test files,
the credential-free tool regressions, lint, type checking, and Playwright test discovery. Client and Service workflows remain responsible for their
required unit, repository integration, contract, database, and browser integration tests.

The `smoke` operation of the protected `qualify` entry is an on-demand deployed Beta
diagnostic and runs only the small `@smoke` subset. It reads the live deployed tuple,
exercises Beta's real identity boundary, re-observes the tuple before it reports, and
produces no qualification record. It does not run a local database or mutate the deployment.
Only the `full` operation can issue a passing qualification record.

The protected `pnpm test` suite step is reserved for the `full` operation of the `qualify`
entry, and it runs the release-gating selection. Only a passing `full` run against the live
tuple it observed before and after the suite produces qualification evidence that Production
may consume. The
[scenario inventory](docs/scenario-inventory.md) records which scenarios that step's
selection contains; a diagnostic result is not part of it and carries no release
verdict in either direction.

The qualification record states the selection that produced it instead of a constant. Its
`test` member names the invocation the suite step ran and the `--grep` tag that invocation
selects, the SHA-256 digest of the run's own Playwright JSON report, and one entry per
selected scenario with its outcome and how many of its collected tests were skipped. A
scenario's `collected` count counts collected test cases, one per case per declared
Playwright project — a skipped case is still collected and a retried case still counts
once — so a second project would count each case once per project. `test.result` is `passed`
unless at least one selected scenario passed only on a retry, which records it as `flaky`; a
declared skip is recorded in that scenario's own counts and does not change the run result.
A retry-only pass still issues a record, because a retry is the run-level flake control,
while the testing policy's admission condition is about a scenario that routinely needs one.
The suite step writes the report to the path the job declares as
`E2E_QUALIFICATION_REPORT`, and both the qualification evidence artifact and its
diagnostics retain the report, so the digest the record states is auditable against the
bytes it names. Two different verifiers judge that statement. The record verifier a release
gate calls holds no report: from the checkout it is given it re-derives the invocation, the
tag and the membership — the spec titles cross-checked against the
[scenario inventory](docs/scenario-inventory.md) — and refuses a record whose stated
selection or scenario list disagrees with them. The producer's own verify step, which runs
in the job before upload, re-derives the per-scenario outcomes, the counts and the digest
from the report the suite just wrote. A record issued before this change always stays valid,
because the verifier that judges it is always the one from the record's own producing
revision; the current verifier does not accept the retired `suite: 'complete'` shape.

Test classification is explicit: `@smoke` marks the small, stable critical path for the
on-demand Beta diagnostic; `@regression` marks the scenarios admitted to the
release-gating selection; `@full-stack` marks cross-repository scenarios, which every
scenario here carries. A tag selects; the
[scenario inventory](docs/scenario-inventory.md) states the class and the verdict.
Dev verification remains in the Client and Service unit and integration suites.

The non-skipped `worker-smoke.spec.ts` signs in with the existing leased
`workerAccount` fixture and opens Dashboard and Wardrobe. Provisioning, budget,
protected execution, quarantine and Service/Cognito cleanup controls remain shared with
the deployed selection. `auth.spec.ts` and its `E2E_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_OPEN` switch are
retired: registration is gated by the Beta tester allowlist in the Cognito `PreSignUp`
trigger, so public self-registration is no longer a product surface for the scenario to
observe. The [scenario inventory](docs/scenario-inventory.md) records the retirement and its
replacement coverage.

The manual `Beta Qualification` entry (`qualify`) is the single protected dispatch
surface, with the required operation menu `full` (release gate), `smoke` (diagnostic)
and `recover` (account recovery). Its dispatch also carries
`expected_service_commit` and `expected_client_commit` (`full` only), `trigger` (`manual`,
`deploy-smoke` for the deployment smoke hook, `release-qualify` for the release action) and
`dispatched_by` (the dispatching run URL; non-manual triggers only), and the credential-free
preflight validates that combination before any credential job. The `full` operation is the
production-readiness gate for an already-deployed Beta environment. It reads the live Client
`build-metadata.json` and Service `/health`, compares them with the dispatch expectation,
verifies that the live Service commit resolves to an immutable Service release, takes its own
authenticated platform observation, runs the release-gating deployed selection and the oldest
supported Client leg, re-observes and requires an identical tuple, and hands a checksummed v4
record to the credential-free `record` job, which re-verifies it offline and attaches the
artifact. A green `full` run whose record `record` has verified and attached is the complete
release decision; there is no separate approval action or approval Environment, and the audit
trail is the `qualify` dispatch event (actor and time), the run/attempt and the sealed record
tuple. A failed, mismatched, or changed deployment, or a worker task
definition that changed during the suite, cannot issue a passing record. The workflow
requests 90-day artifact retention, subject to GitHub's configured
repository or organization ceiling; durable release-ledger storage remains
out of scope for the initial Production launch. The finite GitHub retention window is an
accepted trade-off: after the artifact expires, that qualification can no longer authorize a
new Production deployment or rollback and the candidate must be qualified again. Persistent
S3 evidence storage will be reconsidered only if long-term audit or rollback requirements arise.

## Runtime Reliability Evidence

### Tester Admission Verification (Historical)

The one-time deployed synthetic allowlist acceptance and recovery workflows were
retired after the feature's acceptance completed. Their historical evidence, including
the owner's real email-code and normal-login confirmation, is recorded in
[AnyWear issue #59](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/59). The ordinary
`full` and `smoke` operations of the `qualify` entry do not mutate tester policy or claim to
verify a real tester mailbox. Future changes to admission behavior should define only the
focused tests needed for that change; the retired deployed harness is not a standing release gate.

The wardrobe scenario verifies repeated `Idempotency-Key` confirmation before and after
completion, recovery after a browser reload, consistent terminal state in two browser
pages, and a monotonic state version. It requires a successful `ready` state, so a
provider failure cannot pass merely because the processing indicator disappears.

Expanded Beta and Production reliability drills are deferred to
[AnyWear issue #58](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/58); they are not current
personal closed-Beta acceptance gates and have not been passed. The manual runtime-drill
and dedicated runtime-recovery workflows were retired under
[issue #79](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/79). Historical Actions runs and
artifacts remain available as evidence of their actual outcomes.

The retained manual runtime instrumentation ladder was retired under
[#213](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/213), together with the admission mode it
operated: `runtime-drill`, `runtime-window-controls`, `nonpaid-runtime-controls`,
`runtime-one-shot`, `runtime-no-start`, `runtime-identity-creation`, `beta-runtime-adapter`
and their exclusive support modules, fixtures and tests. Their admission-window half had no
subject once Beta registration became the only admission decision, and their fault-injection
half had no workflow caller since #79; the testing policy's retirement rule requires an
ongoing owner and trigger for retained tooling, and Git history plus the original run
artifacts preserve their provenance. The credential-free `sse-replica-attribution` contract
is the one retained operational-support regression. Any future expanded-release work must
first select the smallest required risk-based scope in issue #58; the historical
fault-injection design is not an instruction to rerun its full matrix or rebuild a separate
control platform.

The deployed Client must serve the exact reviewed build at an HTTPS URL, support its
browser routes, and expose `/build-metadata.json`. The Client-owned Beta workflow publishes
the static build to the Beta PlatformStack's CloudFront distribution. Qualification reads that
endpoint from the workflow constants `E2E_CLIENT_URL` / `E2E_SERVICE_URL` in
`beta-qualification.yml` (beside `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` / `AWS_REGION`), so an operator does **not**
set `BETA_CLIENT_URL` or edit the `beta` environment for a qualification run; those
environment-scoped copies are unused by this workflow. If a distribution is recreated, the two
workflow constants move with it in one reviewed change.

## CI Model

Qualification reads the live deployed tuple; the committed compatibility pin, its tools and
its two documents are **deleted** (#192), and no release-qualification path reads a committed
deployment file: `beta-qualification.yml`, `pnpm check`, `test:core` and `test:list` were
already pin-free. The former measurement workload was the last executed reader of the pin,
and it was deleted with the sizing apparatus. The last expected-tuple readers were the manual
drill and recovery CLIs, retired under
[#213](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/213), so no tracked command reads a
qualification tuple and no new reader of a committed deployment file may be added.

The live tuple is:

- the Client at `E2E_CLIENT_URL`: `/build-metadata.json` with `schema_version: 3`,
  `component: 'AnyWear-Client'`, `source_commit`, `client_version` and `built_at`;
- the Service at `E2E_SERVICE_URL`: `/health` with `status: 'ok'`, `service_commit`,
  `image_digest` and `minimum_client_version`;
- the platform content this repository observes itself: the three configured stacks'
  `Original` template hashes, the `/anywear/beta/*` stage inputs, the two Lambdas, the two
  queues and the Client distribution domain.

The two endpoints are workflow constants in `beta-qualification.yml` (the same values as the
`beta` environment's `BETA_CLIENT_URL`/`BETA_SERVICE_URL`). They are constants because the
environment-free `preflight` must read the live tuple before any credential job, and a job
without `environment: beta` cannot resolve environment-scoped variables. If a distribution is
ever recreated, the constants move with it in one reviewed change.

The only committed input on the live path is
[`minimum-supported-client.json`](minimum-supported-client.json):
`{ "version": 0, "sha": "<oldest-supported-client-sha>" }`. The Client has no version tag, so
the oldest-Client leg needs the commit named explicitly; the file's `version` must equal the
live Service's `minimum_client_version`, and a disagreement is refused — never resolved by
picking the oldest version — with a message that says to sync the file.

`AnyWear-Service`'s release chain verifies its own sealed release before deploying it; E2E
independently verifies that the live Service commit resolves to an immutable
`service-artifacts-<service sha>` GitHub release whose tag resolves to that same commit and
whose four expected assets — `pre-sign-up.zip`, `post-confirmation.zip`, `runtime-policy.json`
and `service-schema.json` — are each uploaded with a non-empty size and a published
`sha256` digest (`scripts/service-release.mjs`). The gate reads the release and the tag ref
through the GitHub API and downloads no release asset, so the image digest stays in the live
`/health` identity and is no longer compared with a release field. No AWS credential is
requested before that read succeeds. A pre-change five-asset release, which also carries the
retired `service-artifacts.json` manifest, stays qualifiable during the 5→4 transition: the
gate requires the four names it consumes and ignores the extra asset, and it never reads or
parses the manifest.

## Release qualification record v4

`full` writes `qualification-record.json` schema v4. It is self-contained: reading it answers
what was deployed, what was expected, what was observed, which tests ran and which run wrote
it.

| Member | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version`, `record_type` | `4`, `anywear_beta_qualification` |
| `qualification_id`, `result`, `operation`, `qualified_at` | `beta-<run>-<attempt>`, `passed`, `full`, ISO time |
| `environment` | `beta`, account `650880818323`, region `ap-east-1`, the two endpoints |
| `expected` | `{service_commit, client_commit, source}`; `source` is `trigger` when the dispatcher supplied a Service commit, `live` when a manual `full` took the live value at run start |
| `revisions` | `e2e {repository, sha}`, `client {repository, sha, client_version}`, `service {repository, sha, image_digest, minimum_client_version}`; **no `infra`** |
| `service_artifacts` | `{repository, release_id, tag, target_commit, assets}`; `tag` is `service-artifacts-<service sha>` and `target_commit` is the commit the tag resolved to (the qualified Service commit); `assets` is exactly the four released names, each `{size, digest}` with `digest` a `sha256:<hex>` |
| `observations` | `{before, after}`; each is `{collected_at, client{url, source_commit, built_at}, service{url, service_commit, image_digest}, platform{stacks, inputs, schema_sha256, lambdas, queue_config_sha256, client_domain}, authenticated: true}` |
| `test` | the derived selection, the report digest and one outcome per selected scenario |
| `workflow` | `{repository, path, ref, run_id, run_attempt, run_url, trigger, dispatched_by}` |
| `integrity` | `{algorithm: 'sha256', payload_sha256}` |

v4 replaces v3's `manifest_asset_id`/`manifest_sha256` with the release's own identity, so no
record member names a manifest asset and the release gate never reads one. There is no
`compatibility` and no `deployment` member either: the record consumes no producer
deployment record, and the observation is this repository's own authenticated platform read
(`scripts/infra-observation.mjs`) through the vendored contract. The deployment-record
lineage — which Infra or Service commit deployed the platform — stays with the deployment
record ([#181](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/181)); the qualification record
proves the deployed *content*.

Before and after the suite, `full` collects the same observation and refuses any difference in
Client, Service or platform. The record's two observations must be identical, and the
`environment` endpoints must match them. `verifyQualificationRecord` re-checks the exact v4
key set, the signed `operation: full`, the expectation and trigger bindings, the observation
stability and order, the committed floor, the four released asset names and digests, and the
integrity digest; it refuses a v2 or v3 record, so one schema version never means two
`service_artifacts` shapes. A release consumer must
call `verifyQualificationForPromotion` with an authenticated completed-success E2E
run/attempt, unexpired exact artifact metadata and the attached record bytes/hash; a checksum
alone does not establish trusted publication.

The release decision is that green `full` run plus the sealed record: `record` is the last
qualification job and there is no approval job, approval Environment or `Approved`/`Rejected`
state. The `qualify` dispatch event (actor and time), the `full` run/attempt and the record
tuple are the audit trail. A failed run produces no record, so there is nothing to release.

## Private retrieval and observation

Private retrieval uses separate GitHub App readers. The immutable Service release identity is
read with a token scoped to `AnyWear-Service` (Contents/Actions read): the gate reads the
release and its tag ref only and downloads no release asset. `recover` reads its original E2E
owner artifact with the workflow token and the historical cleanup diagnostic with an
Infra-scoped reader (`GH_TOKEN`) plus the Service reader, which resolves the recorded release
by tag→commit and immutability without a manifest. `scripts/github-read.mjs` owns the
`gh` seam and the per-repository token scoping that renames the one allowed reader to
`GH_TOKEN` and removes every other reader token. The E2E deployment-record download chain
(`trusted-deployment-inputs.mjs`) and the cross-repository Infra observer checkout
(`infra-source.mjs`) are deleted in Wave 1.

AWS credentials are assumed after the live-tuple gate. `beta-e2e-qualification-role` reads the
three stage-base stacks of the release-slice split (Bootstrap/Foundation, the Base stack
`AnyWearPlatformStack-beta` and Billing; `AnyWear-Service` owns
`AnyWearRuntimeStack-{beta,prod}`), the actual CloudFormation `Original` template content
hashes, the stable Lambda configuration and code hashes, the queue settings, the stage SSM
inputs and the Client distribution domain. The Runtime identity is bound by the deployed
Service `/health` and the Client build metadata. The record's `platform.schema_sha256` is a
content hash of the stage-contract inputs; the database/applied schema identity moved to the
Service release chain with the release slice.

## Ordinary E2E execution

The former offline cross-repository builder gate was retired with the `selection`
contract. The Service release chain verifies its own sealed release before it
deploys, and qualification independently verifies that the live Service commit resolves to
an immutable `service-artifacts-<sha>` release whose tag resolves to that commit and whose
four expected assets carry published digests (`scripts/service-release.mjs`), without
executing the retired Service parser, reading a manifest or downloading a release asset.

Verify that Infra/Client/legacy writers have ceased before allocating an E2E
qualification or recovery window. Repository-local concurrency
does not serialize those other repositories. Keep `ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION` unset or
`false` during preparation. For an authorized protected Beta dispatch, configure:

| Variable | Required value |
| --- | --- |
| `ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION` | `true` only after role/access/cutover gates pass; the single stage switch shared by the system |
| `E2E_CLEANUP_SERVICE_SOURCE_SHA` | Full reviewed deployed Service source SHA bound into the fixed cleanup capability |
| `E2E_CLEANUP_SERVICE_SHA` | Legacy source/operator guard value retained during cutover |
| `E2E_CLEANUP_SERVICE_IMAGE_DIGEST` | Reviewed deployed Service image digest |
| `BETA_CLEANUP_STATE_MACHINE_VERSION_ARN` | Immutable version ARN of the Infra-owned cleanup state machine |
| `E2E_WORKER_SLOT_OFFSET` | Allocated first slot, integer 0 through 7; the selected workers must fit within slots 0 through 7 |
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `AWS_REGION` | `650880818323`, `ap-east-1` |

The protected Beta environment, exact repository/owner IDs, main workflow dispatch,
the single `qualify` entry and the explicitly stated `operation` establish source
identity. `execution-guard.mjs --source-only` checks that identity before credentials,
including that the operation is one of `full`, `smoke` or `recover` and that
the workflow ref is the entry the operation map names. After
assuming the dedicated `beta-e2e-qualification-role`, each operation job captures fresh
STS account/principal values and checks the exact account, role and region. Those
values are supplied by the workflow, not dispatch inputs. The default guard requires
that captured principal before observations, suite and mutation boundaries, including
Cognito deletion after a fixed cleanup operation wait. Missing or mismatched identity
retains the cleanup manifest for protected recovery. `full` has a 90-minute
job bound; `smoke` and `recover` have 60-minute bounds. All three share
the `beta-e2e-account-pool` concurrency group with cancellation disabled. Verify
all local/Actions/CFN/ECS/nested Service jobs have ceased before handing the
environment to another writer; timeout alone never releases it.

The Infra-owned versioned Step Functions cleanup capability invokes Service's fixed
application-data task. An ordinary qualification cleanup and a protected `recover`
dispatch submit the same strict normal-mode envelope and enter the same resume/verify/
retry rule. Recovery validates the completed original E2E owner and captured worker
subjects. A quarantined record whose captured subject and worker-family address (a stable
pool row, or a historical run-scoped address of that run) are intact is
repaired by the same reviewed cleanup — capability tuple, Service commit proof, absence
readback and ledger `deleted` with the original reason preserved — while a record whose
ownership is unproven stays terminal, remains in the manifest and fails recovery. The
operator path is in [docs/account-recovery.md](docs/account-recovery.md). The account artifact preserves the capability execution,
source/image binding and exact cleanup request before any Cognito deletion, including
when later cleanup fails. Legacy `service-cleanup-run.json` records remain accepted as
historical recovery input; new runs use `service-cleanup-operation.json`. E2E does not
check out a mutable cleanup helper or pass the Lifecycle/Cleanup task roles. Service's
surviving operator must select the dedicated `CleanupTaskRoleArn` with no fallback to
the old Lifecycle role. Its legacy image still needs narrowly reviewed data-cleanup
permissions for the two Beta DLQs, while tester-allowlist controls remain outside that role.
None of these operations deploy CDK, change the tester allowlist, or revive the retired
runtime drill.

Operation evidence uses schema 3 and records initiation, observed terminal state,
and a separate `proof_status`. Step Functions success alone does not permit identity
deletion: E2E rechecks the exact execution input/version, both stopped ECS tasks,
their immutable definitions, image/source, fixed command and log paths, and the
unique `ANYWEAR_BETA_CLEANUP_RESULT=` Service completion marker. The marker's envelope
hash binds the actual ECS command bytes, while its request hash binds the original
captured worker JSON. Requests exceeding ECS's 8192-byte serialized override bound
are rejected before starting an execution.

DLQ counters may include messages that the fixed Service implementation proves
belong to deleted terminal tasks. E2E validates nonnegative counters and refuses an
unassigned diagnostic `known_message`; those counters alone do not establish
per-message ownership. Source/image-bound Service validation and live unrelated
data/message preservation evidence provide that acceptance boundary.

Protected account recovery and the ordinary qualification cleanup share one rule. For the
exact captured run scope, the entry point resolves one deterministic execution name,
`beta-cleanup-<runScope>-<requestHash16>`; an absent generation 0 is started under the
current version and normal envelope. It resumes that execution while it is `RUNNING`,
verifies the committed result when it has `SUCCEEDED`, and only when it is terminal
non-success performs the bounded predecessor check: the execution `describe` that
established the terminal state, then one inventory pass over the three bounded cleanup
task families (`beta-anywear-cleanup`, `beta-anywear-cleanup-verify` and
`beta-anywear-cleanup-acceptance`) asking ECS only for `RUNNING`-desired tasks. The
inventory never reads `lastStatus`: any returned task refuses the next start, and an
inventory that cannot complete refuses as well. A task still draining with a `STOPPED`
desired status is therefore outside this single-inventory check. Otherwise the dispatch
starts `beta-cleanup-<runScope>-<requestHash16>-retry1` once, or resumes or verifies that
name when it already exists.

A protected `recover` dispatch supplies the original owner evidence. That evidence is
validated in its own terms, so an execution captured under an older state-machine
version, an older Service image/source or a legacy mode-less owner input is observed and
verified under its own envelope and version. A retry newly started by this dispatch
always uses the current version and normal envelope; a retry already recorded in the
original evidence is observed and, when `SUCCEEDED`, verified under that evidence's own
version and envelope. The original evidence's captured request and run scope must equal
the current canonical request and scope.

A captured run scope therefore carries at most two executions: the base deterministic
name and one `-retry1`. A retry newly started by this dispatch uses the current version
and normal envelope. An existing retry that binds the original owner evidence or the
current pair is resumed when it is `RUNNING` and verified when it is `SUCCEEDED`, under
that envelope and version. A recorded retry that is already terminal non-success refuses
the same way: it records `refusal_phase`/`refusal_category`, starts no third execution and
deletes no identity. An execution that binds neither — for example a retry started
by an earlier recovery under an intermediate reviewed tuple — is refused fail-closed: the
dispatch records `refusal_phase`/`refusal_category`, starts no third execution and deletes
no identity. The retry is the only retry: there is no attempt number, attempt input,
predecessor artifact or execution-history hash, and no second cessation sample. An
operator supplies the captured identities once; the protected `recover` dispatch takes
`source_run_id`/`source_run_attempt`.

Every dispatch always emits `operation_mode: 'normal'` and no `recovery_attempt`; the
envelope keeps the optional attempt field only because the Service validates it.
`validateCommitted` still compares both echoed fields, so a Service that echoes an
attempt is refused. The `recover` operation and its original-artifact preparation remain
the only consumer of the capture inputs in the shared `qualify` entry; partial Cognito
reconciliation never shrinks the canonical cleanup request. Shared account-pool
concurrency does not establish a cross-repository writer allocation; that remains an
operational preflight gate.

The `full` and `smoke` operations accept `worker_slot_offset` (default `0`) for
allocating the run's two worker slots; for example `2` selects slots 2 and 3 without
reusing slots 0 and 1. The admission pre-flight uses the same offset: it requires every
pool address this run can lease, and only those, to be on the tester allowlist before the
first account exists. Recovery always uses the exact captured
original emails/subjects, independent of later slot allocations. An offset does
not establish cessation of other jobs or authorize use of occupied slots: verify
outstanding executions, tasks and manifests are reconciled before reuse.

## Environment change during a suite

A qualification can run across a deployment rotation, and the run now says so instead of
reporting the platform's recovery as a product failure. The workflow records the
identity of the worker(s) serving Beta immediately before and immediately after the
suite - the worker service's task ARN set and the task definition those tasks run - and
compares them. `scripts/qualification-environment.mjs` reads that identity from the
workflow, which holds the scoped AWS credentials; the Playwright spec reads no AWS and
decides no environment change, so the qualification-environment module owns the record
shape and the comparison rules while the spec keeps recording what it observed.

- `.qualification-inputs/beta-environment-before.json` and
  `.qualification-inputs/beta-environment-after.json` are the two captures; the
  after-capture runs even when the suite failed.
- `test-results/beta-environment-verdict.json` is the verdict: `environment-changed`,
  `unchanged`, or `unavailable` when an input is missing or malformed, with
  `product_failure_asserted` and the exact worker task ARNs that appeared and
  disappeared. When the suite passed and `comparison.task_definition_changed` is true,
  this same verdict is what refuses the qualification.

A verdict of `environment-changed` **replaces the product-failure report**: the run
states that the platform was redeployed under the suite and that no product failure is
asserted. It does not turn the run green. When the suite failed, the job still ends
non-success and no qualification record is created. The converse is equally strict: a
case that fails while the worker identity is unchanged is still a product failure, and a
check that could not be established is reported as `unavailable` so the failure keeps
standing instead of being explained away. An `incomplete` suite - one that was cancelled
or ended by the job timeout and so neither passed nor produced a product failure -
asserts no product failure either, because none was established; its red run comes from
the cancelled step. The verdict is a conservative label rather than per-case causation -
the captures bracket the suite and cannot say when a rotation happened relative to the
interrupted case - so a genuine product failure that coincides with a worker replacement
is reported as an environment change and must be re-adjudicated by a re-run.

The verdict is a qualification gate on one branch only: the passing path. A suite that
**passed** while the worker task definition serving Beta changed cannot issue a
qualification - the record path refuses before it writes `qualification-record.json`, and
the `Refuse a qualification measured across two worker definitions` step fails the run with
the same sanitized sentence. The reason for the distinction is what the run measured: a
suite that spanned two task definitions measured neither of them, while a rotation of task
ARNs on one unchanged definition leaves the configuration under test intact. That rotation
is recorded and does not block, so a passing suite on one unchanged definition is still
qualified, and the reason line says which of the two happened: an added-only change reads as
a scale-out, not as workers being replaced. Run
[38879938899](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-E2E/actions/runs/38879938899) is that
rotation - its suite passed, the verdict recorded 2 worker task(s) appeared and none removed
with the task definition unchanged, and the run still created its qualification record. A
redeployment that replaces the deployed tuple is still caught separately by
`Confirm deployed identities remained stable`.

The capture is unconditional for every qualification run, because a deployment change
cannot qualify release evidence of any kind.
