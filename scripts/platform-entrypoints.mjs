// The ONLY committed platform knowledge (#228): the reviewed entry-point identifiers.
//
// The platform observation is a black-box consumer: it discovers the deployed surface
// through AWS public list/describe APIs and hashes it with public standards, so no
// producer source and no committed name list enters this repository. This module carries
// exactly the entry points that discovery is bounded by and nothing else:
//
// - the stage path `/anywear/beta/` the stage base publishes under;
// - the `AnyWear` stack-name prefix;
// - the `beta-anywear-` queue-name prefix, which is also the prefix of the Service-built
//   Lambda function names;
// - the account identity, carried by the qualification credential: read from the
//   execution environment's `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and verified by the observation's STS guard;
// - the observation region set: the credential region `ap-east-1` plus the committed
//   Billing region `us-east-1`;
// - the terminal stack statuses a recorded stack row may carry;
// - the pagination page bound every discovery list read must stay within.
//
// `scripts/platform-entrypoints.test.mjs` is the census that asserts this module
// contains exactly these identifiers and nothing else.
