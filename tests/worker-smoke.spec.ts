// Issue #129 could only be read from CloudWatch because a failing first attempt
// left no trace: the global configuration records one on the first retry, which
// is the second attempt. The profile binding is what this test exists to
// observe, so this file records a trace for every attempt and keeps the failed
// one. `test.use` is file-scoped and top-level because it forces its own worker,
// and the scope is deliberately this file only so no other scenario inherits the
// trace setting or pays for that worker.
