// The deployed invocations select scenarios by tag, so a tag is the scenario's
// declared membership in an invocation. This offline check holds the two ends of
// that contract together: every spec file declares at least one invocation tag on
// its `test.describe` title, and the deployed invocation scripts in package.json
// are exactly the ones the inventory document describes. A renamed or removed tag
// would otherwise drop a scenario out of the release-qualifying selection with
// nothing left to fail, which is the failure this file exists to prevent.
//
// The selection itself is not executed here. A discovery run cannot establish a
// deployed claim, and an offline file cannot load the deployed environment.
//
// The parsers are the qualification record's own: the record states which scenarios
// the release-gating selection contains, and it is derived from these titles, so a
// second copy of the parser here could agree with itself and disagree with the
// record. `scripts/test-selection.mjs` owns them and both callers read them.
