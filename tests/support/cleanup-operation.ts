 * created business resource ID is captured as an exact reference, and
 * teardown runs in `finally` through the existing user-facing DELETE routes.

 * failure never rewrites the product assertion, but it still quarantines the

 *    is deleted before either, and it is the only kind referencing them.

 *    releases along with the items they held, and no generation references it

 * 3. `wardrobe_item` - referenced through those joining rows, which the outfit
 *    delete released.
 * 4. `base_photo` - referenced by generations, which are gone.
